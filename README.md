# HW-1
Air Quality Prediction Using Linear and Logistic Regression Models
• Developed two regression models (linear and logistic) to predict air quality indicators, particularly focusing on carbon monoxide (CO) levels, based on various environmental and sensor data.
• Implemented linear regression from scratch in Python to predict hourly averaged CO sensor responses, achieving effective 5-fold cross-validation with RMSE analysis.
• Designed a binary classification model using logistic regression to label high CO levels, conducting 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
