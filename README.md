# HW-1

Air Quality Prediction Using Linear and Logistic Regression Models

• Developed two regression models (linear and logistic) to predict air quality indicators, particularly focusing on carbon monoxide (CO) levels, based on various environmental and sensor data.

• Implemented linear regression from scratch in Python to predict hourly averaged CO sensor responses, achieving effective 5-fold cross-validation with RMSE analysis.

• Designed a binary classification model using logistic regression to label high CO levels, conducting 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

# HW-2

Decision Tree and XGBoost Classifier for Loan Prediction

1. Developed a decision tree classifier from scratch using Python (without libraries like scikit-learn), processing loan dataset with data cleaning, feature extraction, and split validation.

2. Implemented Gini Index-based splitting criteria, recursive tree building, and predictions for the test dataset, achieving efficient inference.

3. Enhanced model performance through XGBoost with L2 regularization and hyperparameter tuning, demonstrating an AUC score through ROC curve evaluation.
